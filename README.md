# Pomodoro Timer

The Pomodoro Timer project is a Python application that implements the Pomodoro Technique, a popular time management method. This technique breaks work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. The timer helps users stay focused and productive by dividing their work into manageable chunks and providing regular breaks for relaxation.

## Features

- Customizable Durations: Users can set the duration of work sessions, short breaks, and long breaks according to their preferences.
- Visual Countdown: A visual countdown timer displays the time remaining in the current session, making it easy for users to track their progress.
- Work/Break Alternation: The timer automatically switches between work sessions and breaks, allowing users to focus during work periods and take regular breaks to recharge.
- Checkmarks for Completed Sessions: The application displays checkmarks for each completed work session, providing a visual indication of progress.

## Why Use a Pomodoro Timer?

By breaking work into manageable intervals and scheduling regular breaks, users can maintain focus and avoid burnout. The Pomodoro Timer project provides a simple and effective tool for implementing this technique and boosting productivity.
